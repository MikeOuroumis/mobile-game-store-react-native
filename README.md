**Game Store Application**

This project was created using Expo for simplicity reasons and runs specifically
for Android. It uses the following tech stack:

- React Redux
- react-navigation
- expo-linear-gradient
- Animated library from react-native

**_How to run the project_**

1. Go to the root folder of the project in your terminal and run `npm install`
   to install all the dependencies of the project (node required to be installed
   at your pc)
2. Go to "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js" change the path from '../../App' to
   '../../src/App'
3. Open a virtual device from Android Studio, or use your phone to run the
   project with 'Expo Go' (download the app from app store)
4. Go to the root folder of the project in your terminal and run`npx expo start`
5. After starting the project, if you want to run it on a virtual device, go to
   your terminal and press 'a'. To run it on a physical device, scan the QR code
   in the terminal from 'Expo Go'

**_If I had more time_**

- I would use Typescript
- I would implement the functionallity for the premium currency
- I would write better and more maintainable code than this one

That's it! I hope you like it!

# Mobile Game Store Application

This project was created using Expo for simplicity reasons and runs specifically
for Android. It uses the following tech stack:

- React Redux
- react-navigation
- expo-linear-gradient
- Animated library from react-native

## How to run the project

1. Go to the root folder of the project in your terminal and run `npm install`
   to install all the dependencies of the project (node required to be installed
   at your pc)
2. Go to "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js" change the path from '../../App' to
   '../../src/App'
3. Open a virtual device from Android Studio, or use your phone to run the
   project with 'Expo Go' (download the app from app store)
4. Go to the root folder of the project in your terminal and run`npx expo start`
5. After starting the project, if you want to run it on a virtual device, go to
   your terminal and press 'a'. To run it on a physical device, scan the QR code
   in the terminal from 'Expo Go'

## Notes

**Running the app on emulator**

To run the app on an emulator of Android Studio, you have to follow some steps first.

The following link provides a series of steps for how to setup a virtual device and run the application on it.

## If I had more time

- I would use Typescript
- I would implement the functionallity for the premium currency
- I would write better and more maintainable code than this one

That's it! I hope you like it!
